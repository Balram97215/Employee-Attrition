## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict employee attrition using a logistic regression classifier. It serves as a portfolio-ready case study showing applied data science in the HR domain, including data understanding, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Problem Statement

McCurr Healthcare Consultancy, a global MNC, spends significant resources on retaining employees. Blanket incentives are costly, so their People Operations team asked for a **data-driven model** to identify which employees are at higher risk of leaving. This predictive model will help them target retention strategies more efficiently.

---

## Business Context

- Employees leaving an organization (attrition) cost time and money.
- HR needs to focus retention efforts where they matter most.
- This project demonstrates a way to estimate *attrition probability* and classify employee risk in a reproducible, explainable way.

---

## Data Description

The dataset includes **2940 employee records** with 33 features, such as:

- Demographics (Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status)
- Work characteristics (Job Role, Business Travel, OverTime)
- Satisfaction ratings (JobSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance)
- Performance (PerformanceRating, YearsSinceLastPromotion)
- Compensation (MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike)
- The **target variable**: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

ðŸ”¹ **Categorical Features**: 18  
ðŸ”¹ **Numerical Features**: 15

There were **no missing values**, making this a clean HR dataset.

## Solution Approach

This project followed a standard, robust pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Dropped constant or identifier columns (*EmployeeNumber, Over18, StandardHours*)  
   - Validated data types

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
   - Scaled continuous variables using z-score normalization

3. **Train-Test Split**  
   - 80/20 split for robust evaluation

4. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression using scikit-learn  
   - Interpretable coefficients to communicate HR-relevant drivers

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
   - Precisionâ€“Recall curve to assess business trade-offs

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Some key EDA findings included:

- Average employee age: 37 years (range 18â€“60)  
- Median distance from home: 7 km  
- Salary: strongly right-skewed, median ~$6500  
- Most employees had a salary hike of ~15%  
- Average tenure: 7 years  
- Promotion frequency: on average every 2.2 years

Visuals included distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and barplots to understand categorical feature frequencies.

## Modeling Pipeline

- Used `scikit-learn` logistic regression for its interpretability
- Created a repeatable pipeline for:
  - data transformation
  - model fitting
  - probability scoring
- Ensured reproducibility with random seeds
- Performance measured on test data for realistic generalization

---

## Results

- Logistic regression achieved balanced precision and recall  
- Class distribution (Attrition: 16%) handled with standard class weighting  
- Interpretable coefficients showed how key variables (e.g., OverTime, EnvironmentSatisfaction) influenced attrition risk  
- Confusion Matrix and PR curve showed reasonable performance for business use

---

## Key Insights

âœ… Employees working overtime were at higher risk  
âœ… Employees with poor environment or job satisfaction were more likely to leave  
âœ… Long commute distance was another attrition driver  
âœ… Employees with fewer recent promotions had higher attrition risk  
âœ… The model is practical for quarterly HR reviews

## Next Steps

- Extend with advanced ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Automate retraining in HR workflows  
- Build a Power BI or Tableau dashboard for HR teams  
- Integrate with an HRMS system for real-time scoring
